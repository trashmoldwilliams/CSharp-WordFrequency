#Word Frequency Counter

Word Frequency Counter is a site that allows the user to enter a phrase, enter a word, and check how many times that word is in the entered phrase. This was created for the C# Week 2 code review, and is primarily to practice BDD.

This can only be done on a Windows machine.
